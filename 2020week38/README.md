2020: Week 38
September 16, 2020
Challenge by Tom Prowse

This week we are going to have a bit of fun and taken inspiration from one of the Alteryx Weekly Challenges. For this week's challenge we want to build a workflow that will allow us to identify whether two words are anagrams of each other. 

We have selected some words that are related to Tableau Prep & Preppin Data, so can you tell if they are anagrams or not?

**Input**

One file with two tables: 

**1. Words** - the list of words to determine whether they are Anagrams or not.

**2. Scaffold** - this is an optional input to use if you need it!

**Requirements**

* Input the Data
* Determine whether the words are Anagrams. There are the following rules: 
* Anagrams are formed by re-arranging of another word (on the same row)
* All anagrams are one word only
* No letter can be used more than once
* All letters must be used
* Output Data


**Output**

**One Table:**

Three Fields
* Word 1
